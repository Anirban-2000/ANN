# ANN

The provided code demonstrates how to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras to perform binary classification, simulating a customer churn prediction task. It begins by generating a synthetic dataset using the `make_moons` function from Scikit-learn, which creates two interleaving half circles—a common test case for binary classifiers. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets and standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that features have zero mean and unit variance, which helps the neural network train efficiently. A simple feedforward neural network is defined using Keras’ `Sequential` API, consisting of two hidden layers with ReLU activation and an output layer with a sigmoid function, suitable for binary classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. Training is performed over 20 epochs, and performance is tracked using both training and validation data. The training output includes loss and accuracy metrics for both datasets, helping to monitor model learning, detect overfitting or underfitting, and evaluate how well the model generalizes. This example effectively illustrates the complete pipeline of building and training a neural network for binary classification tasks.
